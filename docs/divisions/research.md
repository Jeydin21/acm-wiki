ACM Research is a semester-long program designed for students who want to dive deeper into a subfield of computer science and the process of conducting novel research. This semester, there will be ten unique research projects with a UTD faculty member advising each project. While ACM Research is open to all undergraduates of any major who are interested in researching in a technical field, underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) are encouraged to join so they can build some experience during their time at UTD for future research and job opportunities. Each team has a unique topic to research, and there are multitudes of different niches to explore.

## Application Process
Applying to the program is a simple two step process. Fill out the application and complete the Research Coding Challenge, which must be completed along with the application form. Make sure to apply as soon as possible to have enough time for the coding challenge! If selected for an interview, directors and a few Team Leads will get to know candidates and ask them questions. They will also have the opportunity to explain how they solved or attempted to solve the coding question.

## Team Structure
Next, weâ€™ll be breaking down the structure of ACM Research. If you got in, congratulations! There are ten teams of five, with one Research Team Lead. The Team Lead is still part of the team, but is primarily responsible for supervising and assigning deadlines. While there are no official roles, teams may create unofficial ones to suit their project once the semester begins. Each team will also have a faculty advisor, who is selected by the Team Lead. Faculty advisors usually specialize in the same field as the scope of the research project.

## Event Structure
Throughout the semester, there are build-nights, workshops and socials. There are eleven build-nights, which take place on Mondays at 8:30 PM. Build-nights are a great opportunity for teams to work on their project. Additionally, there are four workshops and socials which are typically paired with one another. Workshops will be centered around topics to assist teams with their project, and socials will give participants an opportunity to meet others outside of their group with games and other fun activities. Some socials will be collaboration with ACM Projects as well!

## Research Symposium
ACM Research wraps up at the end of the semester with one final event: The Research Symposium. All teams will present their work to an audience composed of judges, students, faculty, family and friends! Judges have expertise in various fields of Computer Science and will score the project presentation based on overall presentation, poster content, quality of analysis, etc. One team will be the winner and each member will receive an award.
